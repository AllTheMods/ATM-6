### Release 1.8.3
### Other Changes:
* Mythic Botany errors with world/dimension creation
* Salt/Aquamarine bee spawns
* Bees now spawn in groups of 1-2 bees instead of 1-3
* Salt and Aquamarine bees now spawn in a lot more biomes and have twice the spawn chances to make it easier to find
* Menril Logs and Enriched Menril Logs will now count as the same block when using FTB Ultimine
* Correctly added the Ghastly bee
* Correctly added the Woot farms for Ender Dragon and Gaia bosses
* Fixed Powah energizing orb requiring 1 FE
* Downgraded Lighting Wand to fix an unknown issue causing the light blocks to not emit light anymore after a certain number have already been placed

For the Ultimine changes, you will have to add `/defaultconfigs/ftbultimine-server.snbt` to your `/saves/world/serverconfig/` folder. You might have to do the same with the Refined Storage file, if you haven't, to get the buffed Controller capacity.
